I noticed many people using the framework haven't set the correct access 
flags to their "login-data" dir. This could lead to someone using those 
files to run your bot accounts. Although only other toolserver users can 
see these files, its still an issue. Please make at least that dir "not 
readable" for anyone but "owner". --Pyr0.

There are other files to protect, so I wrote a small script, to call it:
 ./backup
first set it's permissions with:
 chmod u+x backup
 chmod go-rwx backup

============================================================

This is the toolserver account of DrTrigon
and is used primary for DrTrigonBot.

Run DrTrigonBot once (during login):
 nice -n +15 python ./runbotrun.py

Run DrTrigonBot with screen:
(without having to remain constantly logged in,
look at https://wiki.toolserver.org/view/Screen too)
 screen
 nice -n +15 python ./runbotrun.py
use CTRL+A or CTRL+D to logout and
 screen -r
to re-login

============================================================

DrTrigonBot runs now as CRON job, use:
 crontab -l

============================================================

DrTrigonBot runs now through job scheduling (SGE), use:

 cronie -l

from job server (submit.toolserver.org), open e.g. with:

 ssh -i ... drtrigon@submit.toolserver.org
