What is it?
-----------
This module implements a large number of different color operations such as
color space conversions, Delta E, and density to spectral.

Why?
----
Public documentation for color math is very limited, and there were no Python
color math libraries with even a fraction of the common routines implemented.

Requirements
------------
colormath requires NumPy, which you may get from:
 
    http://numpy.scipy.org/

Installation
------------
As root/admin on your machine:
  python setup.py install
  
Documentation
-------------
For documentation, see the project webpage at:

    http://code.google.com/p/python-colormath/
    
There are also a lot of useful examples under the examples directory within
this directory.
